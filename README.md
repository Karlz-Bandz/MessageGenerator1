When we have to send a lot of mails or messages at job
this application helps to make it quicker. 
You can add, delete and edit as many messages you want.

First if you want to add new box you can click the "+" button like below

![Addbtn](https://github.com/Karlz-Bandz/MessageGenerator1/assets/57764322/06f06925-018b-435c-a969-924642e6d24e)

Next, we can see that each box has the three buttons Delete, Edit and Copy

To generate the message template click edit button and add the title and text

At the end message is ready to copy and all you have to do is just click one button. 
All messages are stored in LocalStorage so you don't lose your data after closing
the browswer.
